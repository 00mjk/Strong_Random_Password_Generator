## **Note on Passwords**
<color><i>Make passwords secure as possible to keep unwanted parties out of your accounts. There are multiple resources available online to help with this topic.</i></color>

### **Strong passwords**

 1. At least 8 characters—the more characters, the better
 2. A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
 3. A mixture of letters and numbers
 4. Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]
 5. Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause problems in Web browsers

### **Keep password secure**

 1. Change it regularly—once every three to six months.
 1. Change it if you have the slightest suspicion that the password has become known by a human or a machine.
 1. Never use it for other websites.
 1. Avoid typing it on computers that you do not trust; for example, in an Internet café.
 1. Never save it for a web form on a computer that you do not control or that is used by more than one person.
 1. Never tell it to anyone.
 1. Never write it down.
  
### **Creating Strong Passwords**
<i>Think of a word or phrase, and then substitute the letters with numbers and special characters and mix the case.</i> For example:
 1. Snoopy and Woodstock becomes Sno0py&ws
 2. In the dog house becomes !nTh3dawgHs
 3. Let’s have dinner at 8:00 p.m. becomes Lhd@800pm
 4. Think of a word and a number, then intermix them and mix the case. For example, your elementary school name (Main Street Elementary) and your pet’s birth month and year (12/96) becomes m1A2/i9n6
